# Remote Code Execution (RCE) Scanner

## Introduction
This Python script is a tool designed to scan a given URL for potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. It checks for known RCE signatures in web content, examines responses via socket communication, and inspects specific files like robots.txt. Additionally, it can verify if a site is vulnerable to a specific CVE (CVE-2024-31210).

The script utilizes Python with modules such as requests, socket, re for pattern matching, and colorama for terminal output coloring.

## Usage
### Setup
1. *Python Installation:*
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. *Install Dependencies:*
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing Remote_code_execution_scanner.py.
   - Run the following command to install required dependencies:
     
     pip install -r Requirements.txt
     

### Running the Script
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing Remote_code_execution_scanner.py.
- Execute the script with the following command:

python Remote_code_execution_scanner.py -u http://example.comReplace http://example.com with the URL you want to scan.

### Interpreting Results
- The script will output whether potential RCE vulnerabilities were detected or not.
- If vulnerabilities are detected, it will provide information about the detected vulnerability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
- requests: For HTTP requests.
- colorama: For terminal output coloring.

## Example$ python Remote_code_execution_scanner.py -u http://example.com


## Notes
- This script was developed as an assignment during an internship at Albus Security.
- It is intended for educational and testing purposes under controlled environments.
- Use responsibly and only on websites you have permission to scan.
