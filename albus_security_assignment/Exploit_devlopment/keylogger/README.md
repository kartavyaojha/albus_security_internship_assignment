# Keylogger with pynput

This Python script is a simple keylogger that captures keyboard events and logs them to a file. It was developed as part of my internship at Albus Security. The script demonstrates the use of the pynput library for capturing keyboard input in a Python application.

## Features

- Logs every key press and release.
- Differentiates between regular keys and special keys.
- Stores the log in a file named key_log.txt.
- Stops logging when the Esc key is pressed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pynput library

## Installation

1. *Clone the Repository:*
   ```bash
   https://github.com/kartavyaojha/albus_security_internship_assignment/blob/main/albus_security_assignment/Exploit_devlopment/keylogger/keylogger.py
   
   cd keylogger

## Install Dependencies
- Install the required pynput library using pip
- pip install pynput


Project Context
- This script was developed as an assignment during my internship at Albus Security. The objective  was to create a basic keylogger to demonstrate the use of the pynput library for capturing keyboard events and storing them in a log file. This assignment helped in understanding the importance of ethical considerations in cybersecurity and a concept in python .
